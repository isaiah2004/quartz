# MTEB: Massive Text Embedding Benchmark 

"MTEB is a massive benchmark for measuring the performance of text embedding models on diverse embedding tasks."

The 🥇 [leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard) provides a holistic view of the best text embedding models out there on a variety of tasks.

The 📝 [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.07316) gives background on the tasks and datasets in MTEB and analyzes leaderboard results!

The 💻 [Github repo](https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb) contains the code for benchmarking and submitting any model of your choice to the leaderboard.

## Benchmark your model

Using the [MTEB library](https://github.com/embeddings-benchmark/mteb), you can benchmark any model that produces embeddings and add its results to the public leaderboard.
