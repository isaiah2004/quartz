- **Multimodal understanding** refers to the ability of AI systems to analyze and comprehend content across various modes, such as **text, speech, images, and videos**.




- **Recent Advances in Multimodal Research**:
    
    - **Meta AI**, for instance, has been at the forefront of multimodal research. Here are some recent breakthroughs:
        - **Omnivore**: A single model that operates on **images, videos, and 3D data** using the same parameters. It recognizes 3D models and videos even though it was trained only on images.
        - **FLAVA**: A foundational model trained across **35 tasks**, including image and text recognition. It can describe image content, reason about text entailment, and answer questions about images.
        - [**CM3**: An open-source multimodal model with broad applicability](https://ai.meta.com/blog/advances-in-multimodal-understanding-research-at-meta-ai/)[1](https://ai.meta.com/blog/advances-in-multimodal-understanding-research-at-meta-ai/).
