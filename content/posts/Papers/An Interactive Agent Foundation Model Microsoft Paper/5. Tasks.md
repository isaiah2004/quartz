There is potential of foundational models that are trained across visual, language, and agent capabilities, positing such models as powerful and general-purpose tools that can significantly influence a wide array of interactive tasks. To substantiate this claim, the model was applied to three distinct agent-AI scenarios, each representing a unique domain of downstream tasks:

1. **Robotics:** This domain focused on human-machine manipulation tasks within the physical world, testing the model's ability to interact with and manipulate physical objects in a way that mimics human action and understanding. [[5.1. Robotics Task]] 
2. **Gaming:** In the realm of virtual reality, the model was tested on its capacity for human-machine embodiment, assessing its ability to understand and participate in gaming environments as if it were a human player. [[5.2. Gaming Task]] 
3. **Healthcare:** This scenario explored augmented human-machine interaction within traditional multimodal tasks, evaluating the model's performance in understanding and interacting within hospital scenes, potentially assisting in healthcare delivery. [[5.3 Healthcare Task]] 

For each of these tasks, the pre-trained model underwent fine-tuning with datasets specific to the task at hand. Through this process, the model exhibited reasonable and competitive performance across several metrics, including action prediction, visual understanding, and natural language-driven interactions within gaming environments and hospital settings. The detailed task definitions and the datasets utilized for fine-tuning are further outlined, highlighting the model's adaptability and effectiveness across diverse applications.
