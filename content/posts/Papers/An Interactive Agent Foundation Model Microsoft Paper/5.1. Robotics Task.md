For Robotics Task they tested on guided manipulation tasks.

they used two distinct datasets
1. Language Table - [google-research/language-table: Suite of human-collected datasets and a multi-task continuous control benchmark for open vocabulary visuolinguomotor learning. (github.com)](https://github.com/google-research/language-table)
2. CALVIN - [mees/calvin: CALVIN - A benchmark for Language-Conditioned Policy Learning for Long-Horizon Robot Manipulation Tasks (github.com)](https://github.com/mees/calvin)

In language table they had a robot arm rearrange table top objects.
4.9 million frames
