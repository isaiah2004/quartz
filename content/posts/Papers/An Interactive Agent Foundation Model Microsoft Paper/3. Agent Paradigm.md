The new paradigm for embodied agents is:

*“any intelligent agent capable of autonomously taking suitable and seamless action based on sensory input, whether in the physical world or in a virtual or mixed-reality environment representing the physical world”*

Importantly, An Embodied Agent is considered part of a **collaborative system.** 

It communicates with humans using it's vision and language abilities. Then employs a large set of actions to meet human needs.

This would allow these agents to mitigate cumbersome tasks from VR and real world.

They postulate a system like this requires **three** key systems:

1. Perception 
2. Planning 
3. Interaction 

This paper presents the preliminary research or their proposed **Interactive Agent Foundation Model**.

Achieving Embodiment is not simple. Below are some of the main challenges:

1. Unstructured Environments 
2. open sets of objects 
3. Natural Language interaction and commands
