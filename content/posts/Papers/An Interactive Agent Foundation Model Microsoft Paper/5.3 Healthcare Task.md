for this data set they used real life scene from the ICU of a hospital.

The Videos were captioned by well experienced ICU nurses.

They captioned 5-10 second clips .

They also included important observations based on longer 5-30 minute windows, which included common clinical measures that assist with assessment and treatment of the patientâ€™s condition.

For the analysis described in this paper, we focused on the RASS(Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale) score 

automated documentation has the potential to optimize caretaker time. 

They also used GPT4-V to generate a synthetic dataset of video question answer. that expanded the capabilities of the model. 

this approach is beneficial as the patient data is not stored and as such it can be made available for public use.
