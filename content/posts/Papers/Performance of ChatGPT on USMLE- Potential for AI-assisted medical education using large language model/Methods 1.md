## Methods

- Artificial Intelligence
  - ChatGPT (OpenAI; San Francisco, CA) is a large language model that uses self-attention mechanisms and a large amount of training data.
  - It generates natural language responses to text input in a conversational context.
  - It is effective at handling long-range dependencies and generating coherent and contextually appropriate responses.
  - It is a server-contained language model that cannot browse or perform internet searches.

## Input source

- 376 publicly-available test questions were obtained from the official USMLE website.
- These questions were from the June 2022 sample exam release (USMLE-2022).
- All inputs represented true out-of-training samples for the GPT3 model.
- The inputs were confirmed to be not indexed on Google prior to January 1, 2022.
- Questions with visual assets were removed.

## Encoding

- After filtering, 350 USMLE items were advanced to encoding.
- The distribution of model performance is assumed to be normal.
- This affords 90% power at α = 0.05 to detect a 2.5% increase in accuracy against a baseline rate of 60 ± 20% (σ).
