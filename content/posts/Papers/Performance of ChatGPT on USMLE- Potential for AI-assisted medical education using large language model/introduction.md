- Over the past decade, advances in neural networks, deep learning, and AI have significantly impacted various industries, including manufacturing, finance, and consumer products, enabling applications like automated tagging in photos, text translation, and more.
- Despite these advancements, the application of such technologies in clinical care remains limited due to issues like the lack of structured, machine-readable data and the high variability in the quality of algorithms for clinical care.
- Successful healthcare applications of AI mostly support back-office functions, with few applications being directly used in widespread clinical care.
- The development of clinical AI models requires substantial time, resources, and highly specific training data, which are scarce in healthcare.
- Large general domain models have shown promise in clinical imaging by performing as well as or better than domain-specific models, catalyzing AI activity in medical imaging.
- Recently, ChatGPT, a general Large Language Model (LLM) developed by OpenAI, has gained attention for its ability to perform a wide range of natural language tasks, exhibiting deductive reasoning and chain of thought abilities.
- This study evaluates ChatGPT's performance on the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE), aiming to assess its capability for clinical reasoning and potential use in healthcare.
