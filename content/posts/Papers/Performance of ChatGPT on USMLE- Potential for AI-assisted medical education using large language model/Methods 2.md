Sure, here's a condensed version of the notes while keeping the structure and format:

## Encoding
- Questions were formatted into three variants and input into ChatGPT in the following sequence:
    1. Open-ended (OE) prompting: Simulates free input and natural user query pattern.
    2. Multiple choice single answer without forced justification (MC-NJ) prompting: Reproduces the original USMLE question verbatim.
    3. Multiple choice single answer with forced justification (MC-J) prompting: Requires ChatGPT to provide a rationale for each answer choice.
- Encoders used deliberate variation in lead-in prompts to avoid systematic errors.
- New chat sessions were started for each entry to reduce memory retention bias.
- Ordinary 2-way ANOVA was performed to evaluate AI response accuracy and covariation between encoders and question prompt type.

## Adjudication
- AI outputs were independently scored for Accuracy, Concordance, and Insight (ACI) by two physician adjudicators.
- Physicians were blinded to each other during scoring.
- A subset of 20 USMLE questions was used for collective adjudicator training.
- Interrater cross-contamination was suppressed by staggered review of output measures.
- Each adjudicator provided a complete ACI rating for the entire dataset.
- If consensus was not achieved, a third physician adjudicated the item.
- Interrater agreement between physicians was evaluated using the Cohen kappa statistic.

Please let me know if there's anything else you'd like to know from these condensed notes.
